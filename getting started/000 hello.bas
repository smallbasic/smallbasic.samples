? "0. From sbasicg.exe main 'Navigator' window"
? " (the first screen you see when running sbasicg.exe)"
? 
? "Make sure you are in the directory/folder you want."
? " Sub-directories or folders, under the current one you"
? " are in, are enclosed with square brackets"
? "              [I_am_a Folder]"
? " Only .bas files will show under the folders listing."

? " there are 3 modes from GET POPUP:"
? " Editor [Off] run only mode, Editor [On], Editor [Live]"
? " keep toggling (clicking or tapping that line)"
? " until you see Editor [On]"

? "Comments about Hello.bas:"
? " The PRINT keyword is so often used in SmallBASIC"
? " it has a shortcut ? So we could also write:"
? "? \"Hello World\""
? " and get the same result in output window."
?
? "PAUSE is used to hold the output screen until a"
? " click or keypress, without it you will only see"
? " a flash and then be back in edit window."
?
? "There is an option in GET POPUP to show the Output"
? " screen. Click/tap that and see the Output screen"
? " anytime while you are editing. It comes in handy to"
? " refer to that while tweaking your program."
?
? "A comment about comments:"
? " REM or # can start a whole line comment at the left"
? " most position in a line. But only ' the apostrophe"
? " can be used to the right side of code on a line."
?
? "click to continue......." : pause : cls
? 
? "HELP!"
? " F1 will access keyword category help in the right"
? " column of screen. From there you can access keywords."
? " To exit back to the main editor, use esc."
? 
? " Ctrl+h will give a listing of keyboard shortcuts"
? " in the right column of screen. To exit that, press"
? " esc and get focus back into editor."
?
? " When you run code and get an error message, press esc"
? " to get the focus back into the editor, otherwise all"
? " typing in the editor will be for naught!"
