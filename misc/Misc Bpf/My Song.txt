My Song:

I'm gonna sing my song
And sing it all day long
A song that never ends
How can I tell you
All the things inside my head

The change in these past years
Has made me see our world
In many different ways
How can I tell you
Love can change our destiny

Love can change the world
Love can change your life
Do what makes you happy
Do what you know is right
And love with all your might
Before it's too late

Where did I find all these words?
Something inside of me is burning
There's life in other worlds
Maybe, they'll come to earth
Helping man to find a way

One day, I hope we'll be
In perfect harmony
A planet with one mind
Then I could tell you
All the things inside my head

I'm gonna sing my song
And sing it all day long
A song that never ends
How can I tell you
All the things inside my head

I'm gonna sing my song
A song that never ends
